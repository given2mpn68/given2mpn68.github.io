		<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

				<p>Born and raised in the South Side/Southern Suburbs of Chicago and having lived +25 years of wedded bliss on the North Side of Chicago, Marcus has a most interesting history and background.  Although having a Bachelor's degree in Biology and is a Doctor of Medicine from the prestigious Rush Medical College of the Rush University Medical Center of Chicago, Marcus has been blessed to lead worship for +20 years at Armitage Baptist Church of Chicago in the Logan Square neighborhood. During this time, having had the privilege of introducing the Negro Spiritual "Walk With Me" to this congregation (along with several others through the years) the idea of expanding this opportunity of ministry began to take shape!  It has been an honor to learn and teach others about the rich history and heritage of the African-American community through the trials, struggles and triumphs that are depicted in the songs of our history as a people and specifically in the journey of our walk of faith as told through the Negro Spiritual!!</p>
